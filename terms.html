        <p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Case outcomes are randomized and not guaranteed</li>
          <li>Past outcomes do not influence future outcomes</li>
          <li>Opening cases does not guarantee receiving high-value items</li>
          <li>The value of items received may be less than the cost of the Crystals used</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7.4 Virtual Item Ownership</h3>
        <p>Virtual Items obtained through cases:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Remain the property of the Company until withdrawn to your Steam account</li>
          <li>May be subject to withdrawal requirements and processing times</li>
          <li>Cannot be exchanged for cash directly through our platform</li>
        </ul>
